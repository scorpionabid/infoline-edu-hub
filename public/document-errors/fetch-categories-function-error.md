# fetchCategories Function Error

## Error Description

This error occurs when code tries to call `fetchCategories` as a function, but it's not defined or not properly imported. The specific error message is:

```
Uncaught TypeError: fetchCategories is not a function
```

## Root Cause

The root cause of this error was a mismatch between the expected API of the `useCategories` hook and how it was actually implemented:

1. In the Columns.tsx file, the code was destructuring a `fetchCategories` function from the `useCategories` hook result
2. However, the `useCategories` hook was actually returning an object with `categories`, `isLoading`, `error`, and `refetch` properties, but no `fetchCategories` function
3. The code was trying to call this non-existent function in the `loadData` callback

## Resolution Steps

1. **Updated Columns.tsx**
   - Modified the destructuring assignment to get the correct properties from `useCategories`
   - Changed `fetchCategories` to `refetchCategories` to match the hook's API
   - Updated all references in the component to use `refetchCategories` instead

2. **Standardized useCategories hook**
   - Ensured the hook returns a consistent API with `categories`, `isLoading`, `error`, and `refetch`
   - Made sure the hook properly handles errors and returns empty arrays when needed

3. **Improved error handling**
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff for failed data fetching
   - Implemented proper error state UI to show when data fetching fails

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **API Consistency**: Ensure hooks have consistent return types and property names
2. **TypeScript Typing**: Use proper TypeScript interfaces for hook return types
3. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to hooks explaining their return values
4. **Console Logging**: Add diagnostic logs during development to trace data flow

## Related Components

- `src/pages/Columns.tsx` - The file where the error was occurring
- `src/hooks/useCategories.ts` - The hook that was being called with incorrect API expectations

## Testing

After making these changes, verify that:

1. The Columns page loads correctly without errors
2. Categories are properly loaded and displayed in the filter dropdown
3. The retry mechanism works if there's a temporary data fetching failure
