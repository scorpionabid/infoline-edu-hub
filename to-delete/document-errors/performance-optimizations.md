# Performance and Theming Optimizations

## Theme Issues

### Problem
The application had styling issues where the background was dark, causing poor readability of text. Multiple theme providers were conflicting with each other.

### Solution
1. Consolidated theme providers by using a single ThemeProvider from `ThemeContext.tsx`
2. Updated CSS variables in `index.css` to ensure proper light mode with white backgrounds and dark text
3. Made light mode the default theme
4. Fixed z-index and contrast issues in the UI components

## Excessive API Requests

### Problem
Pages were making too many API requests, with regions page making up to 4381 requests and similar issues on sectors and users pages.

### Solution
1. Implemented React Query with proper caching strategies:
   - Added staleTime of 5 minutes to reduce refetches
   - Used queryClient to manage related queries
   - Implemented proper query invalidation

2. Created optimized hooks for data fetching:
   - `useRegionsQuery` - Optimized regions fetching with caching
   - `useSectorsQuery` - Added filtering and search with debounce
   - `useSchoolsQuery` - Implemented pagination and role-based filtering

3. Added request optimization utilities:
   - Throttling to limit frequent function calls
   - Batch processing for reducing multiple small requests
   - Request limiter to cap concurrent API calls

## Type Definition Issues

### Problem
Multiple TypeScript errors related to missing type definitions.

### Solution
1. Enhanced and consolidated type definitions:
   - Updated `dataEntry.ts` with missing interfaces
   - Added missing types to `column.ts`
   - Created proper types for categories with `CategoryWithColumns`
   - Fixed dashboard data types

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Data Fetching**:
   - Used React Query for caching and automatic data refetching
   - Implemented proper pagination to reduce data transfer
   - Added search with debounce to prevent excessive requests during typing

2. **Performance**:
   - Added throttle utility to limit frequent function calls
   - Implemented batch processing for reducing API calls
   - Added prefetching for better UX during pagination

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Enhanced type definitions for better type checking
   - Implemented proper interfaces for component props
   - Added validation types for form handling

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider implementing virtualized lists for large data displays
2. Add more granular data fetching with field selection
3. Implement server-side filtering and sorting when possible
4. Consider adding service worker for offline caching
5. Implement better error boundary components
6. Add performance monitoring to track improvements
