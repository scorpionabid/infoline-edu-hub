# User Roles Infinite Loop Issue

## Error Description

The Users page was experiencing an infinite loop when fetching user data, causing excessive API calls to Supabase and potentially browser performance issues. This was most noticeable when:

1. Navigating to the Users page
2. Applying filters or pagination
3. After adding or updating a user

## Root Cause Analysis

Several factors contributed to this infinite loop problem:

1. **Missing Dependency Arrays**: The `useEffect` hooks in user-related components weren't correctly specifying their dependencies.

2. **Circular Reference Chain**: Components and hooks were creating circular update patterns:
   - User list updates triggered filter updates
   - Filter updates triggered new data fetching
   - New data triggered re-renders that started the cycle again

3. **State Updates During Renders**: Some components were updating state during the render phase, causing additional re-renders.

4. **Multiple Data Fetching Triggers**: The same data was being fetched from multiple places without coordination.

## Resolution Steps

1. **Fixed Hook Dependencies**:
   - Added proper dependency arrays to `useEffect` hooks
   - Used callbacks and memoization to prevent recreation of functions

2. **Added Debouncing for Filters**:
   - Implemented debouncing for filter changes to reduce API calls
   - Added a small delay before applying filter updates

3. **Centralized Data Fetching**:
   - Consolidated data fetching in a single hook
   - Used React Query for automatic caching and deduplication

4. **Circuit Breaker Implementation**:
   - Added a request counter to track consecutive API calls
   - Implemented a mechanism to break the loop if too many requests occur

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always properly define dependencies in React hooks
2. Implement debouncing for user input that triggers API calls
3. Use React Query or similar libraries to manage API state
4. Add monitoring for API call frequency in development
5. Test components with React's StrictMode enabled to catch render loops
